        Signed in 1968, and entered into force in 1970, the Non-Proliferation Treaty is designed to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to encourage the world to reach total disarmament, and promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology. There are 191 countries that signed it. North Korea, Israel, Pakistan, and India did not sign or withdrew from it. The International Atomic Energy Agency conducts inspections to verify that the signatories are in compliance.
