    <h1>1942 – Start of the Program</h1>
    <span>
    The official start of the nuclear program did not begin until later in 1942. In a top secret decree from the Kremlin on September 28, 1942. The Kremlin suggested that “the Academy of Sciences should present to the State Committee of Defense a report on the possibility for uranium bomb or uranium fuel construction by 1 April 1943.”
    <br><br>
    Lavrenti Beria (infamous for leading the NKVD, the secret police, during the years of Stalin’s gulags) led the program along with physicist Igor Kurchatov. Kurchatov is known as the “father of the Soviet bomb” and led the scientific research of both the atomic and hydrogen bombs. However, after the first nuclear test he came to realize their destructive power in a new way, and became an advocate for the peaceful use of nuclear technology.
