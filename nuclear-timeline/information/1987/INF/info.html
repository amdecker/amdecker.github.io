    <h1>1987 â€“ INF</h1>
    <span>
        The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty was signed in late 1987 by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. The two countries designed the treaty to eliminate all intermediate-range missiles (ground-launch nuclear missiles with ranges from 500 km to 5,500 km). This treaty led to the elimination of 2,692 of intermediate-range missiles. The Soviet SS-20 and the US Pershing II were some of the missiles affected by it.
        <br><br>
        However, on October 20, 2018, Donald Trump said he will withdraw from INF, and on Feb 1, 2019, the US suspended the treaty. On February 2, Russia also suspended their participation in the treaty.
