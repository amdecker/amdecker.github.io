    <h1>1961 – Tsar Bomba</h1>
    <span>
        While the United States focused its efforts on creating smaller bombs with more accurate delivery systems (like ICBMs and MRBMs), the Soviet Union made up for its lack of accurate delivery mechanisms by creating larger bombs. The culmination of this focus was the Tsar Bomba. Yuli Khariton, appointed head of the nuclear research in 1946 by Kurchatov, led the team that developed the Tsar Bomba. The Tsar Bomba, a hydrogen bomb, detonated on October 30, 1961. It was the largest man-made explosion ever – equivalent to 50 megatons of TNT. It had the capacity for 100 megatons, but if such a large explosion took place, the delivery plane would not have escaped. Even still, the explosion shattered windows up to 560 miles away, some of them in Norway and Finland.
