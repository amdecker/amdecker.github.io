    <h1>1972 – SALT I</h1>
    <span>
        SALT I, the first Strategic Arms Limitation Talk, consists of two major pieces. One is the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the other is the Interim Agreement and Protocol on Limitation of Strategic Offensive Weapons. 
        <br><br>
        In the 60s, the Soviet Union began to increase their arsenal of ICBMs while also developing Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) systems. ABMs would allow one country to launch a first strike and limit the destructiveness of a retaliation. Soviet development of Anti-Ballistic Missile systems began in 1962/63, but construction was slow. Eight sites were planned, each with 16 interceptors, however by 1969/70 only 4 sites were open. Both countries wanted to limit the development of ABMs because ABMs would reduce effectiveness of deterrence if one or both sides could prevent missiles from exploding. 
        <br><br>
        The ABM Treaty, signed in 1972, limited both the US and USSR to 2 ABM sites with a total of 200 interceptors. One of the sites could protect a national capital, the other could protect ICBMs. However, a protocol to the treaty, signed in 1974, limited each country to one ABM site. The USSR chose to protect Moscow. The US chose to protect an ICBM field near Grand Forks, North Dakota. On December 13, 2001 (just after 9/11), the US withdrew from treaty, effective 6 months later.
        <br><br>
        The Interim Agreement and Protocol on Limitation of Strategic Offensive Weapons is the second part of the SALT I talks. The Interim Agreement froze the number of ICBMs and SLBMs at the current level for 5 years until another agreement would be put in place. However, SALT I did not limit development of new weapons or MIRVs (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle). A MIRV is one missile with multiple warheads – which makes the limitation of the number of ICBMs and SLMBs less important. The US Senate approved the ABM treaty on Aug. 3, 1972. Congress approved the Interim Agreement.
