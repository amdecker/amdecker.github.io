    <h1>1963 – Partial Test Ban Treaty</h1>
    <span>
        After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom got together to sign the Partial Test Ban Treaty in Moscow. They signed it August 5, 1963, and the United States Senate ratified it on September 24, 1963. Glenn Seaborg, a scientist for the Manhattan Project and Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, led the push for this treaty. The treaty addressed fears of environmental catastrophe as a result of nuclear weapons. The treaty limited testing “in the atmosphere; beyond its limits, including outer space; or under water, including territorial waters or high seas.”
