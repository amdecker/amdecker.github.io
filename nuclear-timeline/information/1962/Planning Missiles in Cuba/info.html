    <h1>1962 – Planning Missiles in Cuba</h1>
    <span>
        May 21, 1962
        <br>
        In terse document, Khrushchev issues a few orders regarding putting missiles in Cuba: 
        <blockquote>“Station nuclear missiles [there].
        Carry this out secretly. Then declare it.
        Missiles under our command.
        This will be an offensive policy.”</blockquote>
        The statement that this will be an “offensive policy” contradicts Sergei Khrushchev, the son of Nikita Khrushchev, who said that placing missiles in Cuba was just carrying out a normal policy of defense. Placing missiles in Cuba continues the policy of protecting all allies whether they are important or unimportant. Sergei Khrushchev compared the Soviet Union’s relationship with Cuba to the United States’ relationship with West Berlin. The only difference is that the Soviet Union is used to always having enemies close by – whether it is the Germans in World War II, Napoleon, or Austria-Hungary. The United States on the other hand gets really freaked out at the slightest threat near their territory.
