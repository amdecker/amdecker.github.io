    <h1>1962 – Cuban Missile Crisis</h1>
    <span>
        <b>October 14</b>: A United States U-2 spy plane took photos of MRBM IRBM sites.
        <br><br>
        <b>October 15</b>: Photos sent to the White House 
        <br><br>
        <b>October 16-21</b>: Kennedy gathered his advisors together to discuss the situation. Soviet diplomats denied offensive missiles were being prepared in Cuba. Kennedy had a few choices. On one end, he could send bombers to Cuba to try to destroy the sites. On the other end of the spectrum, he could issue a few angry worded statements to Cuba and the Soviet Union and hope for the best. 
        <br><br>
        On the first day of the Executive Committee meetings, Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, said, “I’ll be quite frank. I don’t think there is a military problem here…This is a domestic, political problem.” The existence of missiles in Cuba did not greatly change the balance of power between the two countries. However the existence of the missiles put Kennedy in a tough position politically, as he had campaigned on the existence of a missile gap and being tough on Castro and Khrushchev.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>October 22</b>: JFK announces the existence of the missiles in Cuba, and declares a naval quarantine – not a blockade, because blockades are an act of war. This fiddling with language backs up the State Department’s legal adviser saying, “Our legal problem was that their action wasn’t illegal.” 
        <br><br><br>
        <b>October 24</b>: Khrushchev sends a letter to JFK saying,
            <blockquote>“Therefore, we do not accept these resolutions. International law exists, generally accepted standards of conduct exist. We firmly adhere to the principles of international law and strictly observe the standards regulating navigation on the open sea, in international waters. We observe these standards and enjoy the rights recognized by all nations.”</blockquote>
        In addition, Khrushchev says the quarantine “is the madness of a degenerating imperialism.”
        <br><br><br>
        <b>October 26</b>: Khrushchev sent a message saying, “If there is no intention...to doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot. We are ready for this.”
        <br><br>
        <b>October 27</b>: Khrushchev sends a second note saying any resolution must involve the US taking its Jupiter missiles out of Turkey.
        <br><br>
        The US ignored the message from the 27th, but Robert Kennedy met with the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin, and told Dobrynin that US was planning on removing missiles from Turkey anyways. However, Robert Kennedy said that information could not be a part of the public resolution of the crisis.
        <br><br>
        <b>October 28</b>: Khrushchev says that missiles in Cuba will be dismantled and taken out of Cuba.
        <br><br>
        <b>November 20</b>: The US quarantine ends.
        <br><br>
        <b>April 1963</b>: The US removes missiles from Turkey.
        <br><br>
        The lack of easy communication led both superpowers to realize the need for a direct hotline between the two leaders. In addition, both powers realized how close to nuclear war they were, and the Cuban Missile Crisis led them to consider the Partial Test Ban Treaty.
