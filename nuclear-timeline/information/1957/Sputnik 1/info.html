    <h1>1957 – Sputnik 1</h1>
    <span>
        In October, just a few months after the first Soviet ICBM test, the USSR launched the first ever satellite into space. The satellite, Sputnik, was small – it had a diameter of 58 cm (23 inches) and weighted 83.6 kg (183.9 lbs). In other words, Sputnik was a very, very, heavy beachball. Its launch marked the start of the space race. At the time, the New York Times said that “military experts have said that the satellites would have no practicable military application in the foreseeable future,” but “study of such satellites could provide valuable information that might be applied to flight studies for intercontinental ballistic missiles.” This event, in combination with the recent Soviet ICBM tests sparked fears in the United States about a scientific and technological gap between Soviet Union and the United States. This fear in the US led to the creation of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958.
