    <h1>1941 â€“ German Invasion of USSR</h1>
    <span>
        Operation Barbarossa was the code name of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It began on June 22, 1941. The BBC at the time reported that "Joseph Stalin, appears to have been taken completely by surprise."
        <br><br>
        Nuclear research was given far less priority after the invasion, even though some Soviet scientists, like Peter L. Kapitza (winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978), said that the idea of a uranium bomb was promising, and that nuclear energy could be used in the war against Germany. Instead of working on nuclear weapons research, most scientists were told to work on more pressing technologies, like radar.
