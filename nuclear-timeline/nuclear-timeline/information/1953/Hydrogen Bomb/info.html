    <h1>1953 – Hydrogen Bomb</h1>
    <span>
        On March 5, 1953, Stalin died and Georgi Malenkov became the leader of the Soviet Union. While he was only in power for a few months, during that time the USSR successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. Hydrogen bombs are many times more powerful that a standard atomic bomb. In a hydrogen bomb, an initial fission reaction is used to start a far more powerful fusion reaction which releases much more energy.
        <br><br>
        The USSR obtained large quantities of information about hydrogen bombs from Klaus Fuchs in the 1940s. Andrei Sakharov led the Soviet research into hydrogen bombs, and is known as the “father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb.” He invented the “Layer Cake” model for the hydrogen bomb which the USSR used in their first hydrogen bomb test. However, despite being extraordinarily influential in creating one of the world’s most powerful destructive devices, Sakharov began to voice concerns about the dangers of nuclear testing and proliferation. He wrote letters to Soviet leaders about the dangers, and by the late 60s, after publicly criticizing the Soviet Union’s civil rights and nuclear policies, he got kicked out of Soviet research programs. In 1975 he won the Nobel Peace Prize (but the USSR did not allow him to leave the country to receive it in Norway).

        On November 1, 1952 the United States conducted its first hydrogen bomb test, called Mike Shot. Less than a year later, on August 8, 1953, Malenkov declared the United States no longer had a monopoly on hydrogen bombs. Shortly thereafter, on August 12, the USSR conducted their first hydrogen bomb test, RDS-6s (aka “Joe-4”).
