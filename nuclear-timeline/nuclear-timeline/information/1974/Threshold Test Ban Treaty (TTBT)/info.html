    <h1>1974 â€“ Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT)</h1>
    <span>
        The Threshold Test Ban Treaty limited underground nuclear tests to 150 kilotons (equivalent to 150,000 tons of TNT). The Soviet Union and United States both signed the TTBT in 1974, however neither party agreed to observe the limits proposed by the treaty until 1976, and the treaty did not enter into force until 1990.
