    <h1>1981 – Project RYaN</h1>
    <span>
        Project RYaN was a collaboration between the KGB and the East German Ministry of State Security (Stasi) from 1981 to 1989. The project was supposed to help the USSR predict a surprise nuclear attack by NATO. Germany did not get involved in Project RYaN until 1985; however, Yuri Andropov as chairman of the KGB and as General Secretary after Leonid Brezhnev, was a proponent from the start. At least 300 new positions in the KGB were created for work on Project RYaN. 
        <br><br>
        Determining a surprise nuclear attack is very difficult because nuclear weapons can be used within 24 hours. Project RYaN looked at an enormous variety of factors that would help the Soviet Union predict an attack.
        <br>
        Among them are (all are direct quotes):
        <ul>
            <li> 5. Noticing the fact of the order forwarded to troops to launch missiles.</li> 
            <li> 1.1. Holding of extraordinary meetings by the National Security Council of the United States and of special crisis groups (White House “situation room”).</li> 
            <li> 1.1.3. Arrival of former US Presidents in Washington.</li> 
            <li> 1.1.6. Parking of a large number of vehicles used by official people at the parking lot of the White House (at the area adjacent to the White House).</li> 
            <li> 1.1.7. Reduction of meetings by the US President and the Secretary of State with representatives of the mass media.</li> 
            <li> 1.2.7. Significant increase in anti-Soviet propaganda, unleashing of a war hysteria.</li> 
            <li> 1.2.8. Statements in the press, radio, and on TV about an increase of aggressiveness in USSR policy, and the subsequent need to take countermeasures in this context.</li> 
            <li> 1.3.3. Removal of nuclear weapons from stocks and distribution of nuclear ammunition to the units.</li> 
            <li> 2.1.3. Increase of traffic in communication systems “Alpha”, “Bravo”, “Green Pine”, and others.</li> 
            <li> 2.1.10. National control and takeover of commercial communication networks.</li> 
            <li> 1.1.11. More frequent than usual (once within 24 hours) distribution by the NATO situation room of intelligence overviews that are unrelated to the bloc's large command staff exercises.</li> 
            <li> 3.2.1. Conducting a mass campaign to donate blood, with an expansion of the number of pure blood donors, plasma donors, and paid donors.</li> 
        </ul>
