    <h1>1979 â€“ SALT II</h1>
    <span>
        SALT II negotiations began in 1972 and continued for seven years. The final treaty limited the number of missiles that can have multiple warheads (MIRVs), limited the number of long-range bombers, and limited the number of strategic launchers to 2400 on each side. A strategic launcher is a missile like an ICBM or SLMB that can have MIRVs. 
        <br><br>
        Jimmy Carter and Leonid Brezhnev signed SALT II in Vienna on June 18, 1979. However, in January 1980, the USSR invaded Afghanistan. This action led Carter to remove the treaty from consideration by United States Senate. Despite this symbolic action, both sides followed the treaty limits until 1986 when Ronald Reagan decided to break the treaty.
        <br><br>
        Both sides had motivations for agreeing to the treaty. The Soviet Union signed it due to a fear of closer US/China relations. The United States signed it due to the fear of falling behind the Soviet Union in the arms race.
