    <h1>1991 â€“ START I</h1>
    <span>
        The START I treaty, signed on July 31, 1991, by George H.W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, focused on reducing the quantity of nuclear weapons. One major aspect of the treaty limited each side to 6,000 warheads each side. The treaty did not enter into force until 1994 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. After the collapse, Russia assumed the role as a nuclear state.
