    <h1>1939 – Preliminary Steps</h1>
    <span>
        The Soviet Union slowly began research into atomic weapons in 1939. In 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann (both Germans) discovered fission. This discovery prompted the Soviets in 1939 to attempt to recreate the fission experiment and try to determine under what conditions a nuclear chain reaction would occur (for a sciency explanation of fission vs fusion and chain reactions see the the back of this card). A letter from People’s Commissariat Of Power Plants And Electrical Industry to The Council Of People’s Commissars Of USSR entitled "On The Organization Of The Research Activities On The Nuclear Atom" suggested locating the preliminary research at the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology in Kharkov, Ukraine. This facility was chosen over building a new one in Moscow to save costs:
            <blockquote>
            "[T]his institute has good facilities and resources for nuclear atom research...[i]f a modern cyclotron is constructed for this institute and if the qualified staff of researchers from the Leningrad Institute of Physics and Technology is concentrated here, there would be a concentration of resources and costs, and the Academy of Sciences of USSR will receive a strong nuclear atom research center. In this case there is no need to spend resources for creating this kind of center in Moscow."
            </blockquote>
        This emphasis on saving costs is interesting in light of what Stalin told Igor Kurchatov a year later about how Kurvhatov, a nuclear scientist, would have access to all the resources he needed regardless of cost (see <b>1946 – Making Progress</b>).
