    <h1>1950 – Espionage</h1>
    <span>
        While any country with resources, willpower, and knowledge can create a nuclear weapon, some estimate that espionage helped the Soviet Union get an atomic bomb six months to two years faster. The Soviet espionage project, codenamed ENORMOZ, involved hundreds of Americans. Many were members of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) and passed information to the Soviets for idealogical reasons, not for money. 
        <br><br>
        The idea of nuclear supremacy and the possible devastation of the world motivated Theodore Hall, one of the more important spies. He gave information about nuclear research to the USSR in order to level the playing field. He wrote, “It seemed to me that an American monopoly was dangerous and should be prevented. I was not the only scientist to take that view.”
        <br><br>
        Klaus Fuchs was possibly the most important spy for the Soviet Union. Originally from Germany, he became a British citizen, signed the United Kingdom’s Official Secrets Act, and then worked at Los Alamos. Harry Gold, a KGB agent, contacted him in 1944. He passed secrets to the USSR through Harry Gold until 1950 when he was caught and charged with a violation of the Official Secrets Act. After serving 9 years in prison, he moved to East Germany and continued performing nuclear research there.
