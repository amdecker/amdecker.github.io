    <h1>1940 – Preliminary Steps</h1>
    <span>In April of 1940, two nuclear scientists from the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology proposed that the Soviet Union start secret research into atomic weapons. They suggested starting with research into chain reactions of Uranium-235 because they knew that such research was already underway in the United States and Germany (with no successful chain reactions by that time – the first successful chain reaction would not happen until Enrico Fermi did it in 1942 at the University of Chicago). The Soviet scientists acknowledged that the practical use of energy from a fission reaction is "a more or less distant prospect to which we should strive, rather than a question for the present-day."

    By October of 1940, Soviet scientists at the Ukranian Institute of Physics and Technology had concrete plans for the first steps in creating a nuclear weapon. One such step was to use a centrifuge to isolate uranium isotopes.
