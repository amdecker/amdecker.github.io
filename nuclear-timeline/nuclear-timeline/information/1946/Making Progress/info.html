    <h1>1946 – Making Progress</h1>
    <span>
        In January 1946, Igor Kurchatov, the Soviet physicist, took notes on a meeting he had with Stalin and Beria. In this meeting, Stalin promised Kurchatov that “utmost assistance will be provided” to help the development of an atomic bomb on “a Russian scale,” and that “it is not worth spending time and effort on small-scale work.” Stalin also tells Kurchatov that there is no need to worry about the cost of anything – the first priority is developing a working bomb. In terms of the people that will be working on this project, Stalin shows the underside of how favors were exchanged in the Soviet Union when does not hesitate to assure Kurchatov that “we can always make it possible for several thousand persons to live well, and several thousand people better than very well, with their own dachas, so that they can relax, and with their own cars.”

        In 1946, Kurchatov appointed Yuli Khariton to be lead scientist. Khariton directed “atomic research, development, design, and weapons assembly, and helped select and establish the site of the secret Soviet nuclear weapons facility, known as Arzamas-16 and nicknamed ‘Los Arzamas.’”

        On December 25, 1946, almost one year after Stalin promised nearly unlimited resources for nuclear research, the Soviet Union successfully created their first chain reaction. This chain reaction was similar to that of the first ever chain reaction created by Enrico Fermi in a basement of the University of Chicago in 1942.
