    <h1>1961 – Missile Gap</h1>
    <span>
        According to Greg Thielmann, “after the launch of Sputnik, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev bragged that his country’s factories ‘were turning out missiles like sausages’ and greatly exaggerated the size and operational capabilities of the Soviet ICBM force. Asked at the time by his son why he was doing so, he explained that ‘the number of missiles we had wasn’t so important.…The important thing was that Americans believed in our power.’”
        <br><br>
        Most Americans definitely believed Khrushchev. In 1961, the CIA estimated the USSR had 50-100 ICBMs. The USAF assistant chief of staff for intelligence disagreed with the CIA, and said that the USSR had “at least” 120 ICBMs, and probably would have 300 by mid 1962. The Director of intelligence in the State Department said the Soviet Union had 75-125 ICBMs, but possibly 150 to 300 in a year. The lowest estimate came from the Army and the Navy who said that the Soviets had 50 ICBMs. Meanwhile, the United States in 1961 had only 40. So the military and intelligence experts thought that the Soviet Union had, at the very least, the same number of ICBMs as the United States. However, Daniel Ellsberg, a former researcher at RAND, best known for leaking the Pentagon Papers, got word of new, hard intelligence – pictures of Soviet ICBM sites – that showed the USSR had only four ICBMs at just one site. These four ICBMs were the Soviet Union’s entire arsenal. This intelligence was so top secret that the very existence of the clearances needed to know the information was known only to those that possessed that clearance. So in reality, there was a missile gap, but it was 10 to 1 in favor of the United States. Khrushchev was bluffing and everyone bought it.
        <br><br>
        It had been almost four years since the first Soviet ICBM test – plenty of time for the USSR to create far more than four ICBMs. After 1962, the United States had enough Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and ICBM silos that no first strike could completely destroy their arsenal. However, before 1962, the USSR needed only ~300 missiles to destroy all the Strategic Air Command (SAC controls much of the United States nuclear arsenal) bases and ICBM sites. According to Ellsberg, “Since it seemed clear that the Soviets <i>could</i> have produced and deployed many, many more missiles in the three years since their first ICBM test, it put in question – it virtually demolished – the fundamental premise that the Soviets were pursuing a program of world conquest like Hitler’s.”
